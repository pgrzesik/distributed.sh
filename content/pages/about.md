My name is Piotr Grzesik. I'm a software engineer, speaker, Ph.D. student and co-organizer of [Pykonik](https://www.pykonik.org/). Most of my interests revolve around general software engineering, distributed systems, serverless architecture and everything DevOps-related. As a part of my Ph.D. programme, I'm researching topics related to edge computing and edge analytics. On this blog I want to share my experiences, opinions and document my learning processes.

Since English isn't my first language, I'm also hoping to brush up my language skills.
